# Microsoft Identity Manager 2016

Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) 2016 builds on the identity and access management capabilities of [FIM 2010 R2](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj133885.aspx). Like its predecessor, MIM helps you manage the users, credentials, policies, and access within your organization.  Additionally, MIM 2016 adds a hybrid experience, privileged access management capabilities, and support for new platforms.

In addition to existing identity management functionality included in [FIM](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj133868). MIM 2016 provides new features and enhancements such as:

- Privileged Identity Management
- New functionality in certificate management
  - [Certificate Management REST API Reference](./reference/certificate-management-rest-api-reference.md)
  - Support for multi-forest topologies.
  - A Windows app for virtual smartcard
  - Updated events and troubleshooting capabilities. 
- Self-service scenarios now include Account Unlock and Azure MFA (multifactor authentication) gate for Password Reset.

## Hybrid experience

Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 works alongside [Azure AD](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis) to give you control over your full environment. Hybrid reporting in Azure AD presents your cloud and on-premises data in one place. Also, the [Self Service Password Reset portal](working-with-self-service-password-reset.md) supports Azure multi-factor authentication (MFA).

## Privileged Identity Management

Privileged Identity Management controls and manages administrative access by providing temporary, task-based access to sensitive resources. This means you can give users only as much permission as necessary, which lowers the chances of a cyber attacker gaining full administrative access. In addition, Privileged Identity Management extracts and isolates administrative accounts from existing Active Directory forests.

MIM supports an on-premises Privileged Identity Management solution for managing Active Directory. To get started, [Use Privileged Access Management](./pam/privileged-identity-management-for-active-directory-domain-services.md).
