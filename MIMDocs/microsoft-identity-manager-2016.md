# Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 news and updates

Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) 2016 builds on the identity and access management capabilities of Forefront Identity Manager. Like its predecessor, MIM helps you manage the users, credentials, policies, and access within your organization.  Additionally, MIM 2016 adds a hybrid experience, privileged access management capabilities, and support for new platforms.


With MIM, an organization can simplify identity lifecycle management with automated workflows, business rules and easy integration with heterogeneous platforms across the datacenter. MIM enables the organization to have the right users and access rights for Active Directory for on-premises apps, and Azure AD Connect can then make available in Azure AD for Office 365 and cloud-hosted apps. Common MIM scenarios include:
 - Automatic identity and group provisioning based on business policy and workflow-driven provisioning
 - Integration of the contents of directories with HR systems and other sources of authority
 - Synchronizing identities between directories, databases, and on-premises applications through common APIs and protocols, Microsoft-delivered connectors, and partner-delivered connectors

The current release under mainstream support is MIM 2016 Service Pack 1 (SP1).  This release in August 2017 included updates to MIM Portal, PAM scenario and added support for new platforms.  Customers running FIM or MIM versions prior to MIM 2016 SP1 should upgrade to MIM 2016 SP1 or a later hotfix.  Read more about [Upgrading to MIM 2016 SP1](./reference/version-history.md).
