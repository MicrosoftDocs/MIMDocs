# Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 Portal Customization


>[!Warning]
Be sure to clear the browser cache when any CSS customizations are made.

In Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 (MIM), you can customize selected elements of the password portals,
including the banner logo, string resources, and cascading style sheets.

In order to do this, a few things are required depending on the level of
customization. The following is a list of items that are involved in customizing
the MIM 2016 password registration and reset portals.

-   Customizations Folder - This is the folder that MIM 2016 will check prior
    to using the defaults. Each portal that will be customized requires a
    Customizations folder. Customizations should only be done in this folder
    because setup will not overwrite it on upgrades, change mode installs or
    repair mode installs.

-   Strings.resources - This is an XML-based file that allows you to modify the
    strings that appear in the portal. This file needs to reside in the
    Customizations folder.

-   Style.css – This is the cascading style sheet used by the portals for
    customization. This style sheet needs to be created and modified to change
    the logo or can be entirely replaced with your own customizations.

For detailed step-by-step instructions on customizing the password registration
and password reset portals see Test Lab Guide: Demonstrating MIM 2016
Password Registration and Reset Portal Customization.

>[!WARGNING]
In order for MIM to recognize any customized changes, you must restart IIS by running iisreset.


## Creating the Customizations folder

On startup, MIM will look for the Strings.resources file in the Customizations
folder before using the defaults. You must create a Customizations folder under
the directory for the portal you wish to customize (i.e. Password Registration
Portal or Password Reset Portal). If you want to customize both portals then you
will need to create a Customizations folder under each of the following:

-   C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager\\2010\\Password
    Registration Portal

-   C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager\\2010\\Password
    Reset Portal

### To create the customization folder

1.  Navigate to the C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Forefront Identity
    Manager\\2010\\Password Registration Portal folder.

2.  Create a folder named Customizations.

3.  Navigate back one level to the Password Reset Portal folder, and create a
    folder named Customizations.

## Customizing strings

Many of the strings in the portal UI can be customized by creating a
Strings.resources file and adding this file to the Customizations folder. You
will need to create a Strings.resources file for each portal that you wish to
customize.

### To customize strings

1.  Using notepad, copy the following code below into it and save it to the
    Customizations folder as Strings.resources

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <root>
     <resheader name="resmimetype">
       <value>text/microsoft-resx</value>
     </resheader>
     <resheader name="version">
       <value>2.0</value>
     </resheader>
     <resheader name="reader">
       <value>System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089</value>
    </resheader>
     <resheader name="writer">
       <value>System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089</value>
     </resheader>

    <!-- Customizations begin here -->
     <data name=" QAGateResetTitle " xml:space="preserve">
       <value>Contoso Question and Answer Reset</value>
     </data>
     <data name="ResetPageTitle" xml:space="preserve">
       <value>Contoso Self-Service Password Reset</value>
     </data>
   </root>

   ```
2.  Under the `<!-- Customizations begin here -->` section change the data name
    to match the strings that you wish to customize and enter the value for that
    string between the <value></value> tags. See the list below for the
    strings that can be customized and their default values.

>[!NOTE]
The **Strings.resources** file is language neutral. To create language specific customized strings, you must have that language pack installed, and save the file in the format Strings. `<language>-<culture>.resources` , for example Strings.en-us.resources.

The following is a list of portal strings that can be customized.

## Customizing the logo banner

The default banner on the portal pages can be customized for your organization.
To customize the logo banner:

1.  Create your custom banners and save them as .png files. The files should
    meet the following recommendations:

 - Size: 490 X 50 pixels.

 - Bit depth: 32

2.  Copy the files to the \\Customizations folder in each portal that you want
    to customize.

3.  Create a Style.css file in each folder. Have it point to the Customizations
    folder and the new logo.. You may change the logo name if applicable (i.e.
    /Customizations/contosologo.png). The code should look like the following:

   **Example 1:**

  `.title-block{background:url(../Customizations/fimlogo.png) no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;}`

4.  If you are using Internet Explorer 6.0, you will need to provide an
    alternate non-transparent logo, and add the following code to Style.css:

  `.ie6 .title-block{background-image:url(../Customizations/fimlogo-ie6.png);}`

  **Example 2:**

  `.title-block{background:url(../Customizations/contosologo.png) no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;}`

If you are using Internet Explorer 6.0, you will need to provide an alternate non-transparent logo, and add the following code to Style.css:

  `.ie6 .title-block{background-image:url(../Customizations/contosologo-ie6.png);}`

## Customizing image for SmartPhones

You can customize the image for SmartPhones by using the following. To customize the SmartPhone image:

1.  Create your image and save them as .png files. The files should meet the
    following recommendations:

    - Size: 190 X 50 pixels.
    - Bit depth: 32

2.  Copy the files to the \\Customizations folder in each portal that you want
    to customize.

2.  Create a Style.css file in each folder. Have it point to the Customizations
    folder and the new logo.. You may change the logo name if applicable (i.e.
    /Customizations/contosologo.png). The code should look like the following:

  **Example 1:**

```css
@media only screen and (max-width: 480px)

   {

    .title-block

     {
       background: url("path_to_image/imagename.png") no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;
     }

   }
   ```

## Customizing style sheets

You can modify the layout and style of the password portals by using a
customized cascading style sheet (CSS). To use a customized CSS:

1.  Create your customized CSS files and save them as Style.css.

2.  Copy the files to the \\Customizations folder in each portal that you want
    to customize.

The following is a basic example of a Style.css file:

```css
body
{
  font: 15px Algerian;
  color: \#303030;
  background: white;
}

.pad
{
  padding: 30px;
  padding-top: 50px;
  background: white;
}

.backgroundWhite
{
  border: \#e9e9e9 2px solid;
} .
title-block
{
background:url(../Customizations/contosologo.png) no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;
}
```


>[!IMPORTANT]
In order for MIM to recognize any customized changes, you must restart IIS by running iisreset.

## Common Customization Issues

The following table is a list of known common issues that can occur with
upgrading the FIM Service and Portal. This table also includes the resolutions
for these issue

|Issue |Resolution                                                                    |
|------|------------------------------|
| I made a string customization but it wasn’t reflected in the UI         | String customizations in strings.resources always require iisreset         |
| After making a strings.resources change, I don’t see any of my string changes anymore     | Strings.resources format is probably malformed and hence is ignored by the portal. Check the event log under Windows Logs – Application and Services Logs – Forefront Identity Manager                        |
| The first time I added Style.css, I did not see my style changes in the portal            | The very first time you introduce a Style.css file, you need to do an iisreset     |
| New styles are added/modified in Style.css but changes are not seen in the browser      | Clear the browser cache and refresh the page <br/> Check the CSS syntax    |
| I directly changed the contents of the CSS folder in path_to_sspr_portal\\css\\\*.css or the banner logo in path_to_sspr_portal\\images\\fimlogo.png and lost these changes on upgrade | You should never change these files to begin with. Only use the Customization folder as a means to provide a banner logo and CSS style customizations in Style.css. Customizations folder is deliberately not overwritten by major upgrades <br/><br/>Do not try to use tools like ILSpy and Reflector to change strings in the portal assemblies.
