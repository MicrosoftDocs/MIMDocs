# Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 portal customization

In Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 (MIM), you can customize selected elements of the password portals, including the banner logo, string resources, and cascading style sheets.

>[!WARNING]
>Always clear the browser cache when any CSS customizations are made.

The following items are involved used for customizing the MIM 2016 password registration and reset portals:

- Customizations folder: This is the folder that MIM 2016 checks prior to using the defaults. Each portal to be customized requires a Customizations folder. Customizations should be done only in this folder as the setup process doesn't overwrite this folder on upgrades, change mode installs, or repair mode installs.

- Strings.resources: This is an XML-based file that allows you to modify the strings that appear in the portal. This file needs to reside in the Customizations folder.

- Style.css: This is the cascading style sheet used by the portals for customization. Create and modify this style sheet to change the logo. You can also replace the entire contents of the style sheet with your own customizations.

For detailed step-by-step instructions on customizing the password registration and password reset portals, see Test Lab Guide: Demonstrating MIM 2016 Password Registration and Reset Portal Customization.

>[!WARNING]
>For MIM to recognize any customized changes, you must restart IIS by running `iisreset`.


## Customizations folder

On startup, MIM looks for the Strings.resources file in the Customizations folder before using the defaults. Create a Customizations folder under the directory for the portal you wish to customize (that is, the Password Registration portal or Password Reset portal). If you want to customize both portals, create a Customizations folder under each of the following locations:

- `c:\Program Files\Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager\2010\Password Registration Portal`

- `c:\Program Files\Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager\2010\Password Reset Portal`

To create a Customizations folder for the Password Registration portal:

1. Browse to the `c:\Program Files\Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager\2010\Password Registration Portal` folder.
   
2. Create a folder named **Customizations**.

To create a Customizations folder for the Password Reset portal:

1. Browse to the `c:\Program Files\Microsoft Forefront Identity Manager\2010\Password Reset Portal` folder.
   
2. Create a folder named **Customizations**.


## Custom strings in the Strings.resources file

Many of the strings in the portal UI can be customized by creating a Strings.resources file and adding this file to the Customizations folder. Create a Strings.resources file for each portal that you wish to customize.

To create customized strings in the Strings.resources file:

1. In Notepad, copy and paste the following code into the Strings.resources file. Save the file in the Customizations folder for the portal.

   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <root>
     <resheader name="resmimetype">
       <value>text/microsoft-resx</value>
     </resheader>
     <resheader name="version">
       <value>2.0</value>
     </resheader>
     <resheader name="reader">
       <value>System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089</value>
    </resheader>
     <resheader name="writer">
       <value>System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, Version=2.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=b77a5c561934e089</value>
     </resheader>

    <!-- Customizations begin here -->
     <data name=" QAGateResetTitle " xml:space="preserve">
       <value>Contoso Question and Answer Reset</value>
     </data>
     <data name="ResetPageTitle" xml:space="preserve">
       <value>Contoso Self-Service Password Reset</value>
     </data>
   </root>

   ```

2.  Under the `<!-- Customizations begin here -->` section in the code, change the data name to match the strings that you wish to customize. Enter the value for the string between the `<value></value>` tags. See the next sections for the strings that can be customized and their default values.

>[!NOTE]
>The Strings.resources file is language-neutral. To create language-specific customized strings, you must have that language pack installed, and save the file in the Strings format `<language>-<culture>.resources`. For example, for the English language culture, the file name is **Strings.en-us.resources**.


## Portal strings
The following table shows the portal strings that can be customized:

## Custom logo banners

The default banner on the portal pages can be customized for your organization.

To customize the logo banner:

1. Create your custom banners and save them as .png files. The files should meet the following recommendations:

   - Size: 490 x 50 pixels.
   - Bit depth: 32 pixels.

2. Copy the files to the Customizations folder in each portal that you want to customize.

3. Create a Style.css file in each folder. Point the file to the Customizations folder for the portal and the new logo. You can change the logo name as needed, such as `/Customizations/contosologo.png`. The CSS should look like the following code:

   `.title-block{background:url(../Customizations/fimlogo.png) no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;}`

4. If you're using Internet Explorer 6.0, you must provide an alternate non-transparent logo, and add the following code to Style.css:

   `.ie6 .title-block{background-image:url(../Customizations/fimlogo-ie6.png);}`

   The CSS should look like the following code:
   
   `.title-block{background:url(../Customizations/contosologo.png) no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;}`


## Custom images for smartphones

You can customize the logo image for smartphones. 

To customize an image for a smartphone:

1. Create your images and save them as .png files. The files should meet the following recommendations:

   - Size: 190 X 50 pixels.
   - Bit depth: 32 pixels.

2. Copy the files to the Customizations folder in each portal that you want to customize.

3. Create a Style.css file in each folder. Point the file to the Customizations folder for the portal and the new logo. You can change the logo name as needed, such as `/Customizations/contosologo.png`. The CSS should look like the following code:

   ```css
   @media only screen and (max-width: 480px)

   {

    .title-block

     {
       background: url("path_to_image/imagename.png") no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;
     }

   }
   ```

## Custom style sheets

You can modify the layout and style of the password portals by using a customized cascading style sheet (CSS).

To use a customized CSS:

1. Create your customized CSS files and save them as Style.css.

2. Copy the files to the Customizations folder in each portal that you want to customize.

The following code is a basic example of a Style.css file:

```css
body
{
  font: 15px Algerian;
  color: \#303030;
  background: white;
}

.pad
{
  padding: 30px;
  padding-top: 50px;
  background: white;
}

.backgroundWhite
{
  border: \#e9e9e9 2px solid;
} .

title-block
{
background:url(../Customizations/contosologo.png) no-repeat scroll 0 0 transparent;
}
```

>[!IMPORTANT]
>For MIM to recognize any customized changes, you must restart IIS by running `iisreset`.

The following code is a more advanced example of a Style.css file. This file provides information that's specific to a smartphone or an Apple iPad for displaying the portals on these devices.

## Common customization issues

The following table lists common issues that can occur when upgrading the FIM Service and MIM Portal.

| Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|
| I made a string customization, but it wasn’t reflected in the UI.                       | String customizations in strings.resources require IIS restart by running `iisreset`. |
| After making a strings.resources change, I don’t see any of my string changes.          | Strings.resources format is probably malformed, and could be ignored by the portal. Check the event log under **Windows Logs** > **Application and Services Logs** > **Forefront Identity Manager**. |
| The first time that I added Style.css, I didn't see my style changes in the portal.     | The first time that you introduce a Style.css file, you need to run `iisreset`. |
| New styles are added or modified in Style.css, but changes are not seen in the browser. | Clear the browser cache and refresh the page. Check the CSS syntax. |
| I directly changed the contents of the CSS folder `<path_to_sspr_portal>\css\*.css` or the banner logo `<path_to_sspr_portal>\images\fimlogo.png`. I lost these changes on upgrade. | Users are recommended to not directly change these files. Only use the Customizations folder to provide a banner logo, and only make CSS style customizations in Style.css. The Customizations folder is deliberately not overwritten by major upgrades. Don't use tools like ILSpy and Reflector to change strings in the portal assemblies. Use strings.resources to override default strings. The assemblies are replaced on upgrade.  |
| Banner logo is not displayed in the portals. I still see the FIM logo.                  | The image name/path in Style.css is not valid, or the browser cache was not cleared.  |
| Banner logo looks ugly in Internet Explorer 6.                                          | Provide a non-transparent image for Internet Explorer 6 with a corresponding style for the image in style.css. |
