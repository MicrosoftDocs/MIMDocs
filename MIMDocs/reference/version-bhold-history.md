# BHOLD modules version release history

The Microsoft Identity Manager team regularly releases updates that are listed in the [version](version-history.md) history. This article helps you keep track of the versions that have been released for BHOLD, a subcomponent of the Microsoft Identity Manager. You can then decide whether you need to update to the newest version or not.  Microsoft does not recommend customers start new deployments of the Microsoft BHOLD Suite components.

## Silverlight end of support

The BHOLD Model Generator, BHOLD Analytics and BHOLD FIM Integration modules will be removed from BHOLD, as these modules have a dependency on Microsoft Silverlight, which will reach the [end of support](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/silverlight-end-of-support-0a3be3c7-bead-e203-2dfd-74f0a64f1788) on October 12, 2021.
