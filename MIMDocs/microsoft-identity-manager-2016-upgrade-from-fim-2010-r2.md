# Upgrade from Forefront Identity Manager 2010 R2

If you have a Forefront Identity Manager (FIM) 2010 R2 environment and want to try out Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) 2016, use this article as your guide. There are three phases in this upgrade:

1.  Install MIM Synchronization Service (Sync) on a server that is domain-joined to your Active Directory (AD) domain. This replaces the FIM 2010 R2 instance of Sync.

2.  Install MIM Service and Portal. At this point, you can also choose to install the self-service password reset (SSPR) registration portal and service portal. and excluding the Privileged Access Management feature set, will then be installed.

3.  Deploy the MIM add-ins and extensions a separate client computer. This includes the SSPR Windows Login integrated client.


This guide assumes that you have the following already set up:
- FIM 2010 R2 deployed in a test environment
- Servers running on Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2008 R2
- Local and environmental pre-requisites (SQL Server, Exchange Server, SharePoint Services, etc.) that are configured for FIM 2010 R2.


## Preparation

1.  Back up your FIM Service database, FIM Sync database, FIM Sync and service configuration and software.

2.  On each server where FIM 2010 R2 components are installed – e.g. *CORPIDM* – log in as Contoso\Administrator. In this  deployment example, Administrative rights are needed to upgrade FIM 2010 R2 to **MIM**.

3.  Download or unpack the MIM software.

## Upgrade the Synchronization Service

1.  Login as an administrator to a server where FIM 2010 R2 Synchronization Service (“Sync”) is deployed.

2.  Make sure to back up your database before you begin this procedure.

3.  Open the **Services** console, locate **Forefront Identity Manager Synchronization Service**, and stop it.

    1.  Tell the MIM Password Reset where MIM Service is installed.

    2.  Specify whether this portal can be accessed by extranet and intranet users, or only intranet users.

## Finish installation and upgrade

1. Once all the configuration definitions are completed successfully, an installation page will appear. Click **Install** to begin the installation and upgrade of MIM Service and Portal.

2. The installation and upgrade of MIM Service and Portal is now in progress. Do not cancel the installer or restart the computer during the installation.

3. Once the installation (upgrade) of MIM Service and Portal is completed successfully, a confirmation screen appears. Click **Finish** to complete the installation and exit the installer.

Note: If the FIM Add-ins and Extensions are currently deployed on user’s computers for SSPR, do not configure the new MFA phone gates for password reset until after all FIM Add-ins and Extensions have been upgraded to MIM 2016.  As the FIM 2010 and FIM 2010 R2 Add-ins and Extensions do not recognize the new gates, they will give an error and a user will not be able to complete password reset.
