# Hardware and software requirements

Privileged Access Management has no hardware requirements beyond those requirements of the underlying software platforms. Just make sure you have sufficient memory or disk space, and network connectivity.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article provides the minimum requirements for a basic deployment on an isolated network. It is not intended to demonstrate performance, scalability, or high availability, and does not represent a recommended deployment topology for large enterprises or production environments.  If your Active Directory is part of an Internet-connected environment, see instead the [securing privileged access](/security/compass/overview) guidance for more information on where to start.
