# Step 2 - Prepare the first PRIV domain controller

>[!div class="step-by-step"]
[« Step 1](step-1-prepare-corp-domain.md)
[Step 3 »](step-3-prepare-pam-server.md)

In this step you will create a new domain that will provide the bastion environment for administrator authentication.  This forest will need at least one domain controller, and at least one member server. The member server will be configured in the next step.

## Create a new Privileged Access Management domain controller

In this section you will set up a virtual machine to act as a domain controller for a new forest

### Install Windows Server 2012 R2

On another new virtual machine with no software installed, install Windows Server 2012 R2 to make a computer “PRIVDC”.

1. Select to perform a custom (not upgrade) install of Windows Server. When installing, specify **Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard (Server with a GUI) x64**; _do not select_ **Data Center or Server Core**.

2. Review and accept the license terms.

3. Since the disk will be empty, select **Custom: Install Windows only** and use the uninitialized disk space.

4. After installing the operating system version, sign in to this new computer as the new administrator. Use Control Panel to set the computer name to *PRIVDC*, give it a static IP address on the virtual network, and configure the DNS server to be that of the domain controller installed in the previous step. This will require a server restart.

5. After the server has restarted, sign in as the administrator. Using Control Panel, configure the computer to check for updates, and install any updates needed. This may require a server restart.

### Add roles

Add the Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and DNS Server roles.

1. Launch PowerShell as an administrator.

2. Type the following commands to prepare for a Windows Server Active Directory installation.

  ```PowerShell
  import-module ServerManager

  Install-WindowsFeature AD-Domain-Services,DNS –restart –IncludeAllSubFeature -IncludeManagementTools
  ```

### Configure registry settings for SID History migration

Launch PowerShell and type the following command to configure the source domain to permit remote procedure call (RPC) access to the security accounts manager (SAM) database.

```PowerShell
New-ItemProperty –Path HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa –Name TcpipClientSupport –PropertyType DWORD –Value 1
```

## Create a new Privileged Access Management forest

Next, promote the server to a domain controller of a new forest.

In this document, the name priv.contoso.local is used as the domain name of the new forest.  The name of the forest is not critical, and it does not need to be subordinate to an existing forest name in the organization. However, both the domain and NetBIOS names of the new forest must be unique and distinct from that of any other domain in the organization.  

### Create a domain and forest

1. In a PowerShell window, type the following commands to create the new domain.  This will also create a DNS delegation in a superior domain (contoso.local) which was created in a previous step.  If you intend to configure DNS later, then omit the `CreateDNSDelegation -DNSDelegationCredential $ca` parameters.

  ```PowerShell
  $ca= get-credential
  Install-ADDSForest –DomainMode 6 –ForestMode 6 –DomainName priv.contoso.local –DomainNetbiosName priv –Force –CreateDNSDelegation –DNSDelegationCredential $ca
  ```

2. When the popup appears, provide the credentials for the CORP forest administrator (e.g., the username CONTOSO\\Administrator and the corresponding password from step 1).

3. The PowerShell window will prompt you for a Safe Mode Administrator Password to use. Enter a new password twice. Warning messages for DNS delegation and cryptography settings will appear; these are normal.

After the forest creation is complete, the server will restart automatically.

### Create user and service accounts

Create the user and service accounts for MIM Service and Portal setup. These accounts will go in the Users container of the priv.contoso.local domain.

1. After the server restarts, sign in to PRIVDC as the domain administrator (PRIV\\Administrator).

2. Launch PowerShell and type the following commands. The password 'Pass@word1' is just an example and you should use a different password for the accounts.

  ```PowerShell
  import-module activedirectory

  $sp = ConvertTo-SecureString "Pass@word1" –asplaintext –force

  New-ADUser –SamAccountName MIMMA –name MIMMA

  Set-ADAccountPassword –identity MIMMA –NewPassword $sp

  Set-ADUser –identity MIMMA –Enabled 1 –PasswordNeverExpires 1

  New-ADUser –SamAccountName MIMMonitor –name MIMMonitor -DisplayName MIMMonitor

  Set-ADAccountPassword –identity MIMMonitor –NewPassword $sp

  Set-ADUser –identity MIMMonitor –Enabled 1 –PasswordNeverExpires 1

  New-ADUser –SamAccountName MIMComponent –name MIMComponent -DisplayName MIMComponent

  Set-ADAccountPassword –identity MIMComponent –NewPassword $sp

  Set-ADUser –identity MIMComponent –Enabled 1 –PasswordNeverExpires 1

  New-ADUser –SamAccountName MIMSync –name MIMSync

  Set-ADAccountPassword –identity MIMSync –NewPassword $sp

  Set-ADUser –identity MIMSync –Enabled 1 –PasswordNeverExpires 1

  New-ADUser –SamAccountName MIMService –name MIMService

  Set-ADAccountPassword –identity MIMService –NewPassword $sp

  Set-ADUser –identity MIMService –Enabled 1 –PasswordNeverExpires 1

  New-ADUser –SamAccountName SharePoint –name SharePoint

  Set-ADAccountPassword –identity SharePoint –NewPassword $sp

  Set-ADUser –identity SharePoint –Enabled 1 –PasswordNeverExpires 1

  New-ADUser –SamAccountName SqlServer –name SqlServer

  Set-ADAccountPassword –identity SqlServer –NewPassword $sp

  Set-ADUser –identity SqlServer –Enabled 1 –PasswordNeverExpires 1

  New-ADUser –SamAccountName BackupAdmin –name BackupAdmin

  Set-ADAccountPassword –identity BackupAdmin –NewPassword $sp

  Set-ADUser –identity BackupAdmin –Enabled 1 -PasswordNeverExpires 1

  New-ADUser -SamAccountName MIMAdmin -name MIMAdmin

  Set-ADAccountPassword –identity MIMAdmin  -NewPassword $sp

  Set-ADUser -identity MIMAdmin -Enabled 1 -PasswordNeverExpires 1

  Add-ADGroupMember "Domain Admins" SharePoint

  Add-ADGroupMember "Domain Admins" MIMService
  ```

### Configure auditing and logon rights

You need to set up auditing in order for the PAM configuration to be established across forests.

1. Make sure you are signed in as the domain administrator (PRIV\\Administrator).

2. Go to **Start** > **Administrative Tools** > **Group Policy Management**.

3. Navigate to **Forest: priv.contoso.local** > **Domains** > **priv.contoso.local** > **Domain Controllers** > **Default Domain Controllers Policy**. A warning message will appear.

4. Right-click on **Default Domain Controllers Policy** and select **Edit**.

5. In the Group Policy Management Editor console tree, navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Local Policies** > **Audit Policy**.

6. In the Details pane, right-click on **Audit account management** and select **Properties**. Click **Define these policy settings**, check the **Success** checkbox, check the **Failure** checkbox, click **Apply** and then **OK**.

7. In the Details pane, right-click on **Audit directory service access** and select **Properties**. Click **Define these policy settings**, check the **Success** checkbox, check the **Failure** checkbox, click **Apply** and then **OK**.

8. Navigate to **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Account Policies** > **Kerberos Policy**.

9. In the Details pane, right-click on **Maximum lifetime for user ticket** and select **Properties**. Click **Define these policy settings**, set the number of hours to *1*, click **Apply** and then **OK**. Note that other settings in the window will also change.

10. In the Group Policy Management window, select **Default Domain Policy**, right-click and select **Edit**.

11. Expand **Computer Configuration** > **Policies** > **Windows Settings** > **Security Settings** > **Local Policies** and select **User Rights Assignment**.

12. On the Details pane, right-click on **Deny log on as a batch job** and select **Properties**.

13. Check the **Define these Policies Settings** checkbox, click **Add User or Group**, and in the User and group names field, type *priv\\mimmonitor; priv\\MIMService; priv\\mimcomponent* and click **OK**.

14. Click **OK** to close the window.

15. On the Details pane, right-click on **Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services** and select **Properties**.

16. Click the **Define these Policies Settings** checkbox, click **Add User or Group**, and in the User and group names field, type *priv\\mimmonitor; priv\\MIMService; priv\\mimcomponent* and click **OK**.

17. Click **OK** to close the window.

18. Close the Group Policy Management Editor window and the Group Policy Management window.

19. Launch a PowerShell window as administrator and type the following command to update the DC from the group policy settings.

  ```cmd
  gpupdate /force /target:computer
  ```

  After a minute, it will complete with the message “Computer Policy update has completed successfully.”


### Configure DNS name forwarding on PRIVDC

Using PowerShell on PRIVDC, configure DNS name forwarding in order for the PRIV domain to recognize other existing forests.

1. Launch PowerShell.

2. For each domain at the top of each existing forest, type the following command, specifying the existing DNS domain (e.g., contoso.local), and the IP address of the master server of that domain.  

  If you created one domain contoso.local in the previous step, then specify *10.1.1.31* for the CORPDC computer’s virtual network IP address.

  ```PowerShell
  Add-DnsServerConditionalForwarderZone –name "contoso.local" –masterservers 10.1.1.31
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> The other forests must also be able to route DNS queries for the PRIV forest to this domain controller.  If you have multiple existing Active Directory forests, then you must also add a DNS conditional forwarder to each of those forests.

### Configure Kerberos

1. Using PowerShell, add SPNs so that SharePoint, PAM REST API, and the MIM Service can use Kerberos authentication.

  ```cmd
  setspn -S http/pamsrv.priv.contoso.local PRIV\SharePoint
  setspn -S http/pamsrv PRIV\SharePoint
  setspn -S FIMService/pamsrv.priv.contoso.local PRIV\MIMService
  setspn -S FIMService/pamsrv PRIV\MIMService
  ```

> [!NOTE]
> The next steps of this document describe how to install MIM 2016 server components on a single computer. If you plan to add another server for high availability, then you will need additional Kerberos configuration as described in [FIM 2010: Kerberos Authentication Setup](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/3385.fim-2010-kerberos-authentication-setup.aspx).

### Configure delegation to give MIM service accounts access

Perform the following steps on PRIVDC as a domain administrator.

1. Launch **Active Directory Users and Computers**.
2. Right-click on the domain **priv.contoso.local** and select **Delegate Control**.
3. On the Selected Users and Groups tab, click **Add**.
4. On the Select Users, Computers, or Groups window, type *mimcomponent; mimmonitor; mimservice* and click **Check Names**. After the names are underlined, click **OK** then **Next**.
5. In the list of common tasks, select **Create, delete, and manage user accounts** and **Modify the membership of a group**, then click **Next** and **Finish**.

6. Again, right click on domain **priv.contoso.local** and select **Delegate Control**.
7. On the Selected Users and Groups tab, click **Add**.  
8. On the Select Users, Computers, or Groups window, enter *MIMAdmin* and click **Check Names**. After the names are underlined, click **OK** then **Next**.
9. Select **custom task**, apply to **This folder**, with **General permissions**.
10. In the permissions list, select the following:
  - **Read**
  - **Write**
  - **Create all Child Objects**
  - **Delete all Child Objects**
  - **Read All Properties**
  - **Write All Properties**
  - **Migrate SID History**
  Click **Next** then **Finish**.

11. Once more, right-click on the domain **priv.contoso.local** and select **Delegate Control**.  
12. On the Selected Users and Groups tab, click **Add**.  
13. On the Select Users, Computers, or Groups window, enter *MIMAdmin* then click **Check Names**. After the names are underlined, click **OK**, then **Next**.  
14. Select **custom task**, apply to **This folder**, then click **only User objects**.    
15. In the permissions list, select **Change password** and **Reset password**. Then click **Next** and then **Finish**.  
16. Close Active Directory Users and Computers.

17.	Open a command prompt.  
18.	Review the access control list on the Admin SD Holder object in the PRIV domains. For example, if your domain was “priv.contoso.local”, type the command
  ```cmd
  dsacls "cn=adminsdholder,cn=system,dc=priv,dc=contoso,dc=local"
  ```
19.	Update the access control list as needed to ensure that MIM service and MIM component service can update memberships of groups protected by this ACL.  Type the command:

```cmd
dsacls "cn=adminsdholder,cn=system,dc=priv,dc=contoso,dc=local" /G priv\mimservice:WP;"member"
dsacls "cn=adminsdholder,cn=system,dc=priv,dc=contoso,dc=local" /G priv\mimcomponent:WP;"member"
```

20. Restart the PRIVDC server so that these changes take effect.

## Prepare a PRIV workstation

If you do not already have a workstation computer that will be joined to the PRIV domain for performing maintenance of PRIV resources (such as MIM), follow these instructions to prepare a workstation.  

### Install Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 Enterprise

On another new virtual machine with no software installed, install Windows 8.1 Enterprise or Windows 10 Enterprise to make a computer *“PRIVWKSTN”*.

1. Use Express settings during installation.

2. Note that the installation may not be able to connect to the Internet. Click to **Create a local account**. Specify a different username; do not use “Administrator” or “Jen”.

3. Using the Control Panel, give this computer a static IP address on the virtual network, and set the interface’s preferred DNS server to be that of the PRIVDC server.

4. Using the Control Panel, domain join the PRIVWKSTN computer to the priv.contoso.local domain. This will require providing the PRIV domain administrator credentials. When this completes, restart the computer PRIVWKSTN.
