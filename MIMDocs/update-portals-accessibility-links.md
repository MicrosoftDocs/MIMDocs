# Update MIM Portals with links to accessibility statements


## Updating MIM Portal


## Updating SSPR registration and reset portals

For customers who are [licensed for Azure Active Directory Premium](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-licensing), we recommend using [Azure AD self-service password reset](/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-sspr-howitworks) to provide the end-user experience.  Azure AD self-service password reset provides both a web-based and Windows-integrated experience for a user to reset their own password, and supports many of the same capabilities as MIM.  For customers which have not yet deployed Azure AD self-service password reset for their users, MIM also provides self-service password reset portals.
