# Install MIM 2016: Synchronize Active Directory and MIM Service

> [!NOTE]

> - Domain controller name - **mimservername**
> - Domain name - **contoso**
> - Password - **Pass@word1**

By default, MIM Synchronization Service (Sync) does not have any connectors configured.  A typical first step is to use MIM Sync to populate the MIM Service database with existing Active Directory accounts. For this, you will use the MIM Sync Service application.

## Create the MIM management agent
The MIM management agent (MA) is a connector for MIM Sync to the MIM Service. To create this connector, you use the Create Management Agent wizard.

When you configure a MIM management agent, you need to specify a user account. This document uses **MIMMA** as the name for this account.

> [!NOTE]
> The account you use for your MIM management agent must be the same account as the one you have specified during the installation of MIM Service.

###To create the MIM MA

1.  Open the Synchronization Service Manager.

2.  To open the Create Management Agent wizard, change to the **Managment Actions** page, then, on the **Actions** menu, click **Create**.

    - On the **Destination** tab, select the attribute shown for that row in the table.

    - To apply the attribute flow configuration, click **OK**.

8. On the **Summary** tab, click **Submit**.

## Initialize the testing environment
There are four steps you need to take before you can test your MIM configuration with AD data:

### Enable Provisioning

1. Open the Synchronization Service Manager.

2. To open the Options dialog box, on the **Tools** menu, click **Options**

3. Select **Enable Synchronization Rule Provisioning**.

4. To close the Options dialog box, click **OK**.

### Initialize the MIMMA

Run a complete synchronization cycle on this connector. The complete cycle consists of the following run profiles:

- Full Import
- Full Synchronization
- Export
- Delta Import

Follow these steps to run each of the four run profiles.

1. Open the Synchronization Service Manager and, on the **Tools** menu, click **Management Agents**.

2. In the **Management Agents** list, select **MIMMA**.

3. To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the **Actions** menu, click **Run**.

4. For each run profile listed above, complete the following steps:

    - To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the **Actions** menu, click **Run**.

    - In the **Run profiles** list, select the run profile you want to run.

    - To start the run profile, click **OK**.

#### Configure attribute flow precedence

During the initialization of the MIM connector, the configured synchronization rules were brought into the metaverse.

Adjust the attribute flow precedence for the attributes contributed by this connector to ensure that attributes already in AD can flow into the metaverse and later also into the MIM Service database.

### Initialize the ADMA

To initialize the Active Directory connector, you need to run a full import and a full synchronization on it. The full import brings the existing objects from AD into the connector space. The full synchronization updates the synchronization rules to match those of the MIM connector.

1. Open the Synchronization Service Manager and in the **Tools** menu, click **Management Agents**.

2. In the **Management Agents** list, select **ADMA**.

3. To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the **Actions** menu, click **Run**.

4. For each run profile listed above, complete the following steps:

    - To open the Run Management Agent dialog box, on the **Actions** menu, click **Run**.

    - In the **Run profiles** list, select the run profile you want to run.

    - To start the run profile, click **OK**.

### Populate the MIM Service database

To populate the MIM Service database with the objects, you need to run a synchronization cycle on the MIMMA connector. The cycle consists of:

- Export
- Full Import
- Full Synchronization

Follow these steps to run each of the three run profiles.

1. Open the Synchronization Service Manager and click **Management Agents** on the **Tools** menu.

2. Select **MIMMA** in the **Management Agents** list.

3. Click **Run**  on the **Actions** menu to open the Run Management Agent dialog box.

4. For each run profile listed above, complete the following steps:

    - Click **Run** on the **Actions** menu to open the Run Management Agent dialog box.
    - Select the run profile you want to run from the **Run profiles** list.
    - Click **OK** to start the run profile.
