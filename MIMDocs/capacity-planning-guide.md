# Capacity planning guide

Microsoft Identity Manager (MIM) lets you create, update, and remove user accounts throughout your organization. It also gives end users the ability to manage their own accounts self-service features. Even in a small environment, all these actions can add up quickly.

Before you get started with MIM use this guide, along with test environments, to understand the appropriate scope for your deployment. This article walks through many common factors that you should take into consideration. Since every deployment is unique, however, testing your scenarios in a lab is still the best way to determine the appropriate servers, hardware, or topologies for your needs.

If you aren't familiar with MIM 2016 and its components yet, get more details about [Microsoft Identity Manager 2016](microsoft-identity-manager-2016.md) before continuing.

## Overview

There are a number of factors that can affect the overall capacity and performance of your Microsoft Identity Manager deployment:

- The ways in which you physically deploy the MIM components (topology).
- The hardware on which those components run.
- The number and complexity of the MIM policy configuration objects are significant factors to consider when planning for capacity.
- The expected scale of the deployment and the expected load are typically more obvious factors that affect performance and capacity.

The main factors that affect capacity and performance of a MIM 2016 deployment are covered in the following table:

| Design Factor | Considerations |
| ------------- | -------------- |
| Topology | The distribution of the MIM services among computers on the network. |
| Hardware | The physical hardware (Physical or virtual) for each MIM component including CPU, memory, network adapter, and hard drive configuration. |
| MIM policy configuration objects | The number and type of MIM policy configuration objects, which includes sets, Management Policy Rules (MPRs), and workflows. |
| Scale | The users, groups, calculated groups, and custom object types to be managed by MIM 2016. Also, consider the complexity of dynamic groups, and be sure to factor in group nesting. |
| Load | Frequency of use. Operations such as new group or user creation, password resets or portal visits per minute or hour. Note that the load may vary during the course of an hour, day, week, or year. Depending on the component, you may choose to design for peak load or average load. |

## Hosting Microsoft Identity Manager components

The components of Microsoft Identity Manager don't have to be located on the same computer. Thinking about these components, and the physical or virtual machines that will host them, is an important part of capacity planning.

Hardware factors can affect the performance of the MIM environment. For example:

- What is the physical disk configuration for the computer running the MIM 2016 Service SQL Database? The number of spindles that make up the disk configuration or the distribution of log and data files can affect the performance of the system significantly.

Also, think about the external factors in your configuration. For example:

- If you are using a SAN as the MIM 2016 Service database configuration, what other applications are sharing the SAN? These applications may affect database performance if they compete for the shared disk resources on the SAN.

## Users and groups

The number of users and groups in your environment is a typical consideration when you think about the scale of a deployment. However, there are several other related considerations that you should also factor into planning.

- Can users create groups? If so, you should consider estimating how users creating new groups will affect the growth of groups in your environment.

- Will dynamic groups be deployed? Figure out how many and what types of dynamic groups to expect in your environment.

## Expected load levels

You should also consider the type of load that will be placed on the MIM components. You will need to estimate the load by looking at current applications in your environment. Some relevant questions to consider include the following:

- How often do you expect a request to join or leave a group?

- How often do you expect a user to create a static or dynamic group?

- How many non-user-driven operations do you expect, such as the synchronization of changes from external systems? Ensure that you account for load that is generated by synchronizing identity information with external systems.

- What kind of scenarios do you plan to deploy? Different scenarios contribute to different load patterns. For example, client computers that have the MIM 2016 client installed periodically validate if registration is required at sign-in.

- Do you expect large variations in load levels, from normal to peak load? For example, there tends to be many password resets after holiday periods. Make sure that you work your system maintenance and synchronization schedules outside the anticipated usage peaks. When you think of capacity planning, ensure that you factor in peak load periods.

## Policy configuration objects

MIM policy configuration objects include the MPRs, sets, workflows, and synchronization rules for a deployment. MIM deployments are unique to each customer because policy configuration changes to fit the needs of each deployment. Key performance considerations include the following MIM policy configuration objects:

- **Sets** Every operation in the system must be evaluated against existing set memberships and updates that cause changes in set membership. For example, a change to the building number of an individual’s office, may not have a huge impact. However, other changes might have a cascading impact, such as the change of a manager, which may affect multiple objects at multiple levels.

- **Management Policy Rules** MPRs manage access control rules and trigger workflows. Creation of MPRs may create the need to increase the number of sets so that you can capture various object transition states. These additional sets may trigger additional workflows, with each workflow mapping to unique requests in the system. This then becomes another item to include when you plan capacity.

MIM policy configuration also includes decisions about provisioning in your environment. Make sure you think about the following:

- Will you be provisioning foreign security principles across multiple Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) forests? Doing so will generate more workflows and requests, which results in additional load on the system.

- Will you use codeless provisioning? If so, this affects the number of expected rules entries, as well as associated requests and workflows in the system.
