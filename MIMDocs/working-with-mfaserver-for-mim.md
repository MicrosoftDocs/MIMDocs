# Use Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server to activate PAM or SSPR

The following document describes how to set up the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server as a second layer of security when your users activate roles in Privileged Access Management or Self-Service Password Reset.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In September 2022, Microsoft announced deprecation of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server. Beginning September 30, 2024, Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server deployments no longer services multifactor authentication (MFA) requests.  Customers of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server must move to instead use either custom MFA providers or Windows Hello or smartcard-based authentication in AD.  To use a different MFA provider, see the article on how to [use Custom multifactor authentication API](Working-with-custommfaserver-for-mim.md).
