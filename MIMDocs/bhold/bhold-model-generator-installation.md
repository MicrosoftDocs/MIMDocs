# BHOLD Model Generator Installation

> [!NOTE]
> The BHOLD Model Generator, BHOLD Analytics and BHOLD FIM Integration modules will be removed from BHOLD, as these modules have a dependency on Microsoft Silverlight, which reached the [end of support](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/silverlight-end-of-support-0a3be3c7-bead-e203-2dfd-74f0a64f1788) on October 12, 2021.

The BHOLD model generator module is deprecated not recommended for new deployments. To bring data into BHOLD Core in bulk, use either the BHOLD API or the BHOLD Access Management Connector.  For information about installing and using the Access Management Connector module, see [Access Management Connector Installation](bhold-access-management-connector-install.md) and [Test Lab Guide: BHOLD Access Management Connector](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj853085(v=ws.10).aspx).
