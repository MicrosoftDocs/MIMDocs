# BHOLD Analytics Installation

The BHOLD Analytics module provides rule-based testing of data access to ensure that your organization can effectively control access to its data and complies with internal and external access requirements. The automated impact analysis generated by the BHOLD Analytics module gives you an overview that shows the number of users who would be affected by the enforcement of a proposed rule, both those who would comply with the rule and those who would violate the rule. The BHOLD Analytics module can also provide a detailed list of the users who would comply with the rule and those who would violate the rule.

## BHOLD Analytics installation requirements

Before installing the BHOLD Analytics module, you must install the BHOLD Core module on the server on which you plan to install the BHOLD Analytics module. For information about installing the BHOLD Core module, see [BHOLD Core Installation](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj134095(v=ws.10).aspx).

## Before you begin

Before you begin to install the BHOLD Analytics module, you need to be prepared to provide the information that the BHOLD Analytics Setup wizard requires to complete the installation. The following worksheet will help you record that information so you will be ready to supply it when it is needed.
