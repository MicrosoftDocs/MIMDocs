# BHOLD Analytics Installation

> [!NOTE]
> The BHOLD Model Generator, BHOLD Analytics and BHOLD FIM Integration modules will be removed from BHOLD, as these modules have a dependency on Microsoft Silverlight, which reached the [end of support](https://support.microsoft.com/windows/silverlight-end-of-support-0a3be3c7-bead-e203-2dfd-74f0a64f1788) on October 12, 2021.

The Analytics module is deprecated and not recommended for new installations.  See the [BHOLD reporting installation guide](bhold-reporting-installation.md) to produce reports from BHOLD.
