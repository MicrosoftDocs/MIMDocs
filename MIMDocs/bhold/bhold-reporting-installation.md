# BHOLD reporting Installation

The BHOLD Reporting module gives you the ability to generate reports about roles and other authorization policies in BHOLD. These reports are often useful for auditing or for demonstrating compliance to regulatory requirements. Also, this module extends your ability to manage authorization within your organization by giving users the information they need to analyze the membership of their roles. The reports can have restricted views that ensure that the users who create reports are shown only the information they are allowed to see.

## BHOLD Reporting installation requirements

Before installing the BHOLD Reporting module, you must install the BHOLD Core module on the server on which you plan to install the BHOLD Reporting module. For information about installing the BHOLD Core module, see [BHOLD Core Installation](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj134095(v=ws.10).aspx).

>[!IMPORTANT]
If you are installing both BHOLD Reporting and BHOLD Attestation, you must install BHOLD Reporting before installing BHOLD Attestation.

## Before you begin

Before you begin to install the BHOLD Reporting module, you need to be prepared to provide the information that the BHOLD Reporting Setup wizard requires to complete the installation. The following worksheet will help you record that information so you will be ready to supply it when it is needed.
